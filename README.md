## How to run this project locally

This project is written with Vite and React, so to run just follow these stpes

1. Install the dependencise `npm install`

2. Run development build `npm run dev`

3. Or if you want to build the project and
   serve run `npm run build && npm run preview`

## Feature notes

1. An actual save and load feature is added where it stores the workflow as
   JSON files and loads from it

2. I am aware of a crash caused by dragging a node through the work area fast,
   work on resolving that is under progress,
   until then just pull the components slowly

3. There can be better implementations to indicating how to
   add and delete nodes and edges (if you have not figured out its backspace to delete
   a selected node and edge) which can be the next feature to implement

4. The settings on selection of a node could have been handled better
